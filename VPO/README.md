Virtual Playing Orchestra CC14 SFZ files
========================================

Please refer to the main README for a description of the content of this folder and how it should be installed and used.

While the rest of the repo is licensed under the GPLv3, you should refer to the [VPO license](http://virtualplaying.com/virtual-playing-orchestra/#licensing) for the contents of this folder instead, since these SFZ files are just a variation of the files originally created by Paul Battersby, the author of the collection, to whom all the credits go.
